      <h1>Educational Facilities Landscape (Canada-wide)</h1>
      <p>Across Canada, billions of dollars are invested every year in education, yet decision-makers still lack a clear picture of where educational resources exist, and where they don’t.</p>
      <p>The Educational Facilities Explorer is a data-driven analytics platform that visualizes the distribution of schools, colleges, and training institutions across Canada using interactive maps and comparative charts.</p>
      <p>Our platform transforms fragmented public datasets into meaningful insights that reveal regional disparities, infrastructure gaps, and underserved communities.</p>
      <p>Unlike static government reports or raw spreadsheets that require technical expertise, our product delivers instant geographic intelligence through intuitive filtering, location search, and province-to-province comparison tools.</p>
      <p>We are starting with education, but our platform is designed to scale to healthcare, housing, and public services, creating a foundation for smarter infrastructure planning nationwide.</p>
      <p>We are seeking collaborators and early investment partners to build this essential tool for public-sector analytics and informed decision-making.</p>
