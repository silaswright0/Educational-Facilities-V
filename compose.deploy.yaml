#Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
#With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, volumes, and other resources.

version: '3.8'  # Specifies the Docker Compose file version which determines the features available

#This section defines the containers that make up your application. Each service represents a container with its configuration
services:  # Defines the services that make up the application

  backend:  # The Spring application service
    #Build Context: build: ./spring tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile located in the ./spring directory.
    build: ./backend  # Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the './spring' directory
    #Ports: ports: - "8080:8080" maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on the host, allowing external access to the Spring application running inside the container.
