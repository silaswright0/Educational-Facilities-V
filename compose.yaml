#Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
#With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, volumes, and other resources.


#This section defines the containers that make up your application. Each service represents a container with its configuration
services:  # Defines the services that make up the application
  backend:  # The Spring application service
    build: ./backend  # Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the './backend' directory
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Exposes port 8080 on the host and maps it to port 8080 in the container
    depends_on:
      - database
    #Environment Variables: These are passed to the container at runtime. For example, DB_ADDRESS is set to jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306, indicating the application should connect to a MySQL database at the given JDBC URL.
    environment:  # Environment variables for the Spring application
      - DB_ADDRESS=jdbc:mysql://database:3306  # JDBC URL for the MySQL database, 'mysql' is the service name in docker-compose
      - DB_DATABASE=template_db  # The name of the database to use
      - DB_USER=root  # The username for the database
      - DB_PASSWORD=pwd  # The password for the database
    #Networks: The service is attached to spring-mysql and spring-react networks, enabling network communication with the MySQL and React services.
    networks:  # Networks the Spring service is connected to
      - backend-database  # Network for communicating with MySQL
      - backend-frontend  # Network for communicating with the React service
    #command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do sleep 3600; done"
  database:  # The MySQL database service
    build: ./database  # Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the './mysql' directory
    environment:  # Environment variables for the MySQL service
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pwd  # The root password for MySQL
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=template_db  # The database to create when the container starts
    volumes:  # Persistent storage for the MySQL database
      - mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql  # Maps 'mariadb_data' volume to the data directory of MySQL
    networks:  # Network the MySQL service is connected to
      - backend-database  # Network for communicating with the Spring service
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"  # Exposes port 3306 on the host and maps it to port 3306 in the container

  frontend:  # The React frontend service
    build: ./frontend  # Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the './react' directory
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # Exposes port 3000 on the host and maps it to port 3000 in the container
    environment:  # Environment variable for the React service
      - BACKEND_PROXY=http://backend:8080  # The URL to the backend Spring service
    networks:  # Network the React service is connected to
      - backend-frontend  # Network for communicating with the Spring service

  ingestor:
    build: ./ingestor # Build from the ingestor Dockerfile
    container_name: python_ingestor
    depends_on:
      - database
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=database
      - DB_DATABASE=template_db
      - DB_USER=root
      - DB_PASSWORD=pwd
    volumes:
      - ./ingestor/data:/usr/app/data  # Mount the data directory into the container
    networks:
      - backend-database
    restart: unless-stopped # Keep container alive unless manually stopped

volumes:
  mariadb_data:  # Defines a named volume 'mariadb_data' for the MySQL service to use for data persistence

networks:  # Defines the networks used by the services
  backend-database:  # Network used by the backend and database services
  backend-frontend:  # Network used by the backend and frontend services
